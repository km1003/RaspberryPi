My C code for the Raspberry Pi

Credit and respect goes to the community for creating the GPIO code
that I have used to get started.  All of the resources I've used can
be found here: http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals#GPIO_Code_examples
Also much respect and thanks to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for inspiring the
next generation of engineers and a new hobby for myself.
