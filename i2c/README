Notes on how I setup the i2c device on the offical Raspian distro

1. remove i2c-bcm2708 from the modprobe blacklist in
   /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

2. added i2c-dev to /etc/modules so that it loads the i2c driver on boot

3. added 'sudo chmod a+rw /dev/i2c*' to .bashrc to allow read/write by default
